	Abstract = {The inverted classroom is a course design model in which students' initial contact with new information takes place outside of class meetings, and students spend class time on high-level sense-making activities. The inverted classroom model is so called because it inverts or ``flips'' the usual classroom design where typically class time is spent on information transfer (usually through lecturing) while most higher-order tasks are done outside the classroom through homework. The inverted classroom model is particularly well-suited for linear algebra, which mixes relatively straightforward mechanical calculation skills with deep and broad conceptual knowledge. In this paper, we discuss how the inverted classroom design can be applied to linear algebra in three modes: as a one-time class design to teach a single topic, as a way to design a recurring series of workshops, and as a way of designing an entire linear algebra course.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the benefits of employing an inverted or ``flipped'' class design in a Transition-to-Proof course for second-year mathematics majors. The issues concomitant with such courses, particularly student acquisition of ``sociomathematical norms'' and self-regulated learning strategies, are discussed along with ways that the inverted classroom can address these issues. Finally, results from the redesign of a Transition-to-Poof class at the author's university are given and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

@article{GavinLaRose2016,
	Abstract = {In 1974, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) issued a far-reaching statement urging the use of calculators in K-12 mathematics education, saying that with the cost of such devices decreasing rapidly, their power and potential was too omnipresent to ignore [6]. This observation is true many times over today: we live in a world in where technology is ubiqui-tous and omnipresent, where computers masquerade as phones and everyone is always online. In this environment, the NCTM's endorsement of the use of calculators---over 40 years ago---suggests that if we are not now considering how technology changes the teaching and learning of college mathematics we are behind a curve set decades ago. The goal of this issue of PRIMUS is therefore to reflect on how different components of our technology-saturated environment influence the teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics. We highlight some of the many different ways that technology is being used in collegiate mathematics instruc-tion today, say something about its effectiveness, and describe some of the strategies used to obtain that level of effectiveness. Obviously, in the face of the breadth of the types of technology available to today's instructors and students, it is not possible to undertake (in a single journal issue!) a complete survey of available technologies and their uses, nor even to present a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of the uses we are able to discuss here. Instead, we explore a representative sample of some of the different technologies available and how they may be used, from computers used in a laboratory setting, to classroom response systems and computer tablet use in the classroom. In this exploration we also investigate the impact the technology use has on student learning and instructor effectiveness. However, " effectiveness " in this context is not easy to define, and less easy to quantify. The assessment of some of the most obvious techniques for increas-ing student learning illustrate this difficulty: for example, while there are many analyses that show that something as simple as homework (not online!) facili-tates student learning (e.g., [1, 4]), there are others that suggest that much of the LaRose and Talbert statistical analysis presented in these is more ambiguous than we might expect [8]. However, although different studies can, and do, illustrate that the use of technology or other pedagogical techniques can improve student learning--- with varying degrees of statistical validity or strength of argument---their real power lies in the replication of results and the accumulated weight of the research record. A specific example of a research area in which there is now an accumu-lation of research that is clear and persuasive is the research on the impact of student engagement and collaborative work on student learning. Here the evidence is already clear, with ever--increasing support: student engagement with the material being learned and students' cooperative work with their peers are fundamental to students' learning of mathematics [5]. And this is great news: these are not things that are unique to any choice of pedagogy or course structure. They are generally applicable to anything we do in our instructional efforts. Thus, the question of effectiveness of a type of technology for the math-ematics learner may be the wrong one: instead, we should be asking how it may be used to promote students' engagement with the material and with each other, and this is one of the things echoed in the articles in this special issue. In this context, the NCTM's statements endorsing the thoughtful use of cal-culators [6] and graphing calculators [7] because they may enhance student learning and understanding of mathematical concepts [2, 3], which are based on a research record that does have significant replication and weight, appear readily applicable to other technology. For all of these reasons we firmly believe that technology can enhance our teaching and our students' learning, even as we believe that, in any form, it will never be a panacea or silver bullet that creates a perfect environment for learn-ing. As such, there will be studies considering the impact of technology that do not provide concrete evidence of its effectiveness, but this does not mean that it is not effective, and there will be many more studies that indicate that it is effective and show how we may use it effectively. The work we present here includes articles that explore new technology or new techniques, that consider effective use of established tools, and which add data to the evaluation of the improvement of learning. In short, they explore the goals we have set forth for the issue, and we hope they inspire readers to think about how technology may enhance student learning, and to consider how it may be appropriate in their own classrooms. The articles that follow span a wide range, from student work to assess-ment, and from there to instruction in a range of formats. Sullivan and Melvin's article, " Enhancing Student Writing and Computer Programming with L A T E X and MATLAB in Multivariable Calculus, " directly considers issues of student learning through the use of typesetting and visualization technology. Lunsford and Pendergrass discuss how the use of an assessment tool (online home-work) may be formative, promoting student learning, in their article " Making},
